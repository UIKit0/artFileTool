artFileTool for Mountain Lion
===================================
artFileTool is a command line tool for encoding and decoding the ArtFile.bin found in `/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/CoreUI.framework/Versions/A/ArtFile.bin`. It its current state it can flawlessly decode the ArtFile.bin into a directory. Command line usage is still in the works.

You can find the SArtFile.bin counterpart [here!](https://github.com/alexzielenski/SArtFileTool)
